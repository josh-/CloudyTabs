## Installation

* [Download CloudyTabs](https://github.com/josh-/CloudyTabs/releases/latest) and copy it to your Applications folder.

> (Alternatively, CloudyTabs is installable from your shell through [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) – once you've [set up Homebrew-cask](https://github.com/phinze/homebrew-cask/blob/master/USAGE.md#getting-started)) you can simply type `brew install --cask cloudytabs`)

## Usage

To use CloudyTabs, open the app and select a tab from one of your devices. The tab's URL then opens it in your default browser (useful if like me, you use Safari on iOS and Chrome on macOS), Cmd(`⌘`)-Selecting a tab (or highlighting it and pressing Cmd(`⌘`)-Return(`⏎`)) opens the tab in the background. Opt(`⌥`)-Selecting a tab (or highlighting it and pressing Opt(`⌥`)-Return(`⏎`)) will copy the tab's URL.

Typing the first few letters or a tab's title will jump to that particular tab.

Hovering over the CloudyTabs menu bar icon displays a tooltip which lists the date that iCloud last updated the synced tabs database or Bookmarks `plist` (where CloudyTabs reads data from).

## Requirements

* macOS 10.13 or later
* An active iCloud account
